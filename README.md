# Chess engine

Future chess engine written in C++. The goal is to write an engine that can outsmart me in a game of chess. 

## Rough plan
- Implement pseudolegal moves
- Implement standard legal moves
- Implement castling, en passant, 50-move rule etc.
- Write simple evaluation function
- Implement simple search algorithms with minimax and alpha-beta pruning
- Expand project to handle SPRT and UCI 
- Write a frontend for better interactibility, probably with node.js
- Write a more sophisticated evaluation function
- Write a more sophisticated search method
- Find a name for the engine
